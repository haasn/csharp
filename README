FreeMonads: Early experiment using boxed free monads, unsafe!
Functors: Early experiment demonstrating mu morphisms, unsafe!
InfEnumerable: Demonstration using Free (,) and Zero for infinite lists
MonadDict: Demonstration of reifying dictionaries to write real monadic code
SumTypes: Experiment of using inheritence for sum types, not too great
